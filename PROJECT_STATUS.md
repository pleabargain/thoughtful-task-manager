## Priority System
The task manager now uses a 5-level priority system:
1. Low (Green) - Can be done when convenient
2. Medium-Low (Blue) - Should be done soon
3. Medium (Yellow) - Important but not urgent
4. Medium-High (Orange) - Important and time-sensitive
5. High (Red) - Critical and urgent

## Next Steps
1. ~~Implement API structure~~
2. Refactor existing code to follow MCP pattern
3. Set up Ollama integration
4. ~~Create basic CLI interface~~

## Notes
- Current focus: Making code API and MCP friendly
- Need to implement proper dependency injection
- Consider adding API documentation
- Plan to add API versioning
- Added rich table display for better task visualization
- Implemented color-coded priority system
